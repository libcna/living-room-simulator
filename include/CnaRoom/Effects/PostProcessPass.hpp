     * @brief Base class for a fullscreen post-process pass.
     *
     * A pass reads one image and writes another. It owns whatever it needs to do that -- its
     * effect, its intermediate targets -- and allocates none of it per frame. Passes are usable on
     * their own: `RenderPipeline` is a convenience that orders them, never a prerequisite.
     *
     * Every pass is capability-gated. Where the active renderer cannot run it, `isSupported()`
     * returns false and `apply()` performs its documented fallback -- for nearly every pass, a
     * pass-through copy -- rather than throwing. A game that enables bloom on a 2D-only renderer
     * gets an unbloomed frame, not an exception.

     * @brief Measures how long the GPU spent on a range of commands.
     *
     * plans/plan_modern.md `MOD-2163`. Every number in `docs/cnaext-perf.md` was measured with a CPU wall
     * clock wrapped around a one-texel read-back, which works but measures the wrong thing twice
     * over: the clock starts when the driver *accepts* the work rather than when the GPU starts it,
     * and the read-back that forces completion is itself a synchronisation the real frame would
     * never perform. This asks the GPU.
     *
     * ```cpp
     * CnaRoom::Effects::GpuTimer timer(device);
     * if (!timer.isSupported()) { … }      // it says why
     * timer.begin();
     * pass.apply(context);
     * timer.end();
     * // …next frame…
     * if (timer.poll()) std::printf("%.3f ms\n", timer.getLastMilliseconds());
     * ```
     *
     * **The result arrives late and that is the point.** A timer whose `end()` waited for its own
     * answer would insert exactly the stall it exists to measure the absence of, so @ref poll never
     * blocks: it returns false until the GPU is finished, which is normally one or two frames after
     * the range closed. A caller wanting a number *now* wants a CPU clock and should say so.
     *
     * **Ranges overlap in flight.** Reopening the timer before the last range's result has landed
     * does not discard that result: up to @ref kRangesInFlight closed ranges wait for the GPU at
     * once, each in its own query, and @ref poll collects them oldest first. A CPU running more
     * than a frame ahead of the GPU is the normal case of a fast renderer without vsync, and with
     * one query the range was reopened every frame before its answer could arrive, so no answer
     * ever did (plans/plan_street_opengl4.md `STREETGL4-0002`). A @ref begin while every query is
     * still waiting times nothing rather than overwrite one.
     *
     * **Where the hardware has no timer query it refuses rather than substituting one.** On GL ES
     * that means `GL_EXT_disjoint_timer_query`, which many drivers — software rasterisers in
     * particular — do not ship. A CPU number wearing a GPU name is worse than no number at all,
     * because it is a measurement of when the driver returned, which is precisely what GPU timing
     * exists to see past.

     * @brief Fog that a light can be blocked from reaching, so it holds the shape of a shadow.
     *
     * `HeightFogPass` answers "how much air is between here and there". This answers the harder
     * question: **how much of that air is lit**. Where the sun reaches the medium it glows; where a
     * wall shadows it, it stays dark -- which is what makes a beam through a window read as a beam
     * rather than as a general haze.
     *
     * **How it stores the volume, and why that is not a `Texture3D`.** The scattering is computed
     * into a *slice atlas*: a 2D render target holding the volume's depth slices side by side, the
     * same layout `ColorGradePass` reads a 3D lookup table from. CNA has a `Texture3D` a shader can
     * sample but no render target that writes into one, and filling a volume with compute needs
     * image stores that GL ES refuses for CNA's textures (`plans/plan_modern.md` `MOD-1514`). An atlas
     * needs neither: one fullscreen draw fills every slice, because each atlas pixel knows which
     * froxel it is and can march to it on its own.
     *
     * The cost is the resolution: the atlas is `sliceCount` slices of `resolution` by `resolution`,
     * so 32 slices at 128 is a 4096 by 128 target. That is deliberate -- volumetric fog is low
     * frequency, and a screen-resolution volume would buy nothing an interpolation cannot.

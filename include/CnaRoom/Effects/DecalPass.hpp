     * plans/plan_modern.md `MOD-2094`. Bullet holes, scorch marks, puddles, tyre tracks: a decal is an
     * image glued onto geometry it knows nothing about. This is the screen-space form of that --
     * for every pixel, the prepass depth gives a position, the decal's inverse transform puts that
     * position in the decal's own space, and the pixel is painted only if it lands **inside the
     * decal's unit box**. Nothing about the receiving mesh has to change, and no geometry is
     * generated.
     *
     * The box is the whole contract, and it is what stops the classic failure: a decal that landed
     * on the wall behind the crate as well as on the crate. A surface further away than the box's
     * far face is outside it, so it is not painted.
     *
     * The decal occupies the local cube from -0.5 to +0.5 on every axis; the texture maps to its
     * local X and Y, and it projects along local **+Z**. So `Matrix::CreateScale(2, 2, 0.5) *
     * Matrix::CreateTranslation(where)` is a two-unit decal that reaches a quarter of a unit in
     * front of and behind the surface it is aimed at.
     *
     * **Give it the prepass normals if you have them.** Without them a decal projected at a glancing
     * angle smears across a surface nearly parallel to its own axis, which is the other classic
     * decal artefact; with them, @ref setMaxSlopeAngle rejects those pixels outright.

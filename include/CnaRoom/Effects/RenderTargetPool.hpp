     * one per mip level. Allocating those per frame would mean creating and destroying GPU
     * textures inside the frame loop -- the cost is not the allocation but the driver-side
     * synchronisation it can force. The pool hands out a target matching a requested shape, and
     * hands back the same object next frame.
     *
     * Targets are owned by the pool and outlive any single `acquire()`; they are released only by
     * `reset()` or by destroying the pool. This is deliberately not a free-list with recycling
     * inside a frame: two passes asking for the same shape in one frame are usually ping-ponging
     * and must get *different* targets, which is what the `slot` parameter of `acquire()` is for.

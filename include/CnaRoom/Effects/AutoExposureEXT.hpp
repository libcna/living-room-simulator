     * plans/plan_modern.md `MOD-1552`, revisiting `MOD-308`. Auto-exposure was out of scope for the
     * tonemapping phase for one concrete reason -- it needs a reduction over the whole frame, which
     * is a compute problem rather than a tonemapping one. Phase 15 gave CNA compute, so this is
     * that reduction and the small amount of control theory around it.
     *
     * The reduction samples a fixed grid over the scene, reduces each work group's samples in
     * shared memory, and returns one partial per group; the last, tiny sum happens on the CPU
     * because reading 64 floats costs less than a second dispatch to add them.
     *
     * **Log-average**, not a plain mean: a few very bright pixels would otherwise drag the whole
     * frame dark, which is exactly the artefact auto-exposure is blamed for.
     *
     * **Adaptation is deliberate and asymmetric.** An eye adjusts to darkness far more slowly than
     * to light, and a camera that snapped instantly to each frame's luminance would strobe on every
     * muzzle flash. @ref update moves the exposure toward its target exponentially, with separate
     * speeds for brightening and darkening.

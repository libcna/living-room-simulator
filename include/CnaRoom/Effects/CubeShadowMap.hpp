     * @brief A point light's shadow, as six faces of a cube map.
     *
     * plans/plan_modern.md Phase 10. A point light casts in every direction, so one map cannot hold its
     * shadow; the scene is rendered six times, once down each axis.
     *
     * **Cube rather than dual-paraboloid** (`MOD-1001`). Dual-paraboloid halves the passes, but it
     * warps geometry in the vertex shader, which means a triangle spanning the paraboloid's seam
     * is wrong unless it is tessellated -- a correctness problem that gets worse with larger
     * triangles, which are exactly the ones a shadow pass wants. `RenderTargetCube` already exists
     * in CNA with real render-into-a-face support, so the cube costs six passes and no new
     * concepts.
     *
     * **What is stored is linear distance from the light, divided by its range** (`MOD-1003`), not
     * projected depth. Projected depth is non-linear and is defined by the projection the *face*
     * used, so comparing against it means reconstructing which face a direction came from and
     * re-deriving that projection. Distance over range is the same number whichever face it landed
     * on, so a receiver samples the cube by direction and compares directly. The cost is that a
     * range far larger than the light actually reaches spends precision on empty space.
     *
     * Usage mirrors `ShadowMap`, once per face:
     *
     * ```
     * cube.update(light);
     * for (int face = 0; face < 6; ++face)
     * {
     *     cube.begin(face);
     *     //   ... draw the casters within the light's range ...
     *     cube.end();
     * }
     * ```

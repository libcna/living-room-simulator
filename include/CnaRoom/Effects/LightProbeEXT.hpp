     * @brief What the light looks like arriving at one point in a scene, as nine coefficients.
     *
     * `ImageBasedLightEXT` lights a whole scene from one environment, applied uniformly: every
     * surface in the level receives the same ambient, whether it is standing in the doorway or at
     * the back of the cellar. A probe is the answer to *where*: it records the incoming light at one
     * position, and a grid of them (`LightProbeVolumeEXT`) makes indirect light vary through a
     * space.
     *
     * **Stored as second-order spherical harmonics**, nine coefficients per colour channel, and
     * that is what makes a grid affordable: an irradiance *cube* per probe would be kilobytes and
     * could not be interpolated between neighbours, while nine values can be averaged directly --
     * the average of two probes' coefficients *is* the projection of the average of their light.
     * Nothing else about the storage would allow trilinear blending at all.
     *
     * What nine coefficients cannot hold is detail. Irradiance is a very low-frequency signal -- it
     * is the environment convolved with a cosine lobe -- so second order is close to exact for it,
     * and correspondingly useless for anything sharp. A probe carries no reflections, no shadows
     * and no visibility; it is the *ambient* term, and `MOD-2083` is where the visibility problem
     * gets its own answer.

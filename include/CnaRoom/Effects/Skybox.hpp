     * @brief Draws an environment cube map as the sky behind a scene.
     *
     * plans/plan_modern.md Phase 11. Small on its own, and the reason image-based lighting is worth
     * looking at: an IBL-lit object reflects an environment the viewer cannot see is a hard sell.
     *
     * **One fullscreen triangle, no cube mesh** (`MOD-1102`). A sky drawn as a box needs a mesh,
     * needs its faces oriented, and puts a seam wherever two of them meet. Reconstructing the view
     * ray per pixel from the inverse view-projection needs none of that: the direction it produces
     * *is* the cube-map lookup, so there is nothing to seam.
     *
     * **The view's translation is stripped** (`MOD-1101`). The sky is infinitely far away, so
     * moving the camera must not move it -- only turning the camera may. Keeping the translation
     * makes the sky slide past like a painted backdrop a few metres out.
     *
     * **Drawn before the scene, not after** (`MOD-1103`, with a recorded deviation). What that row
     * asks for is that the sky never occludes geometry, and it proposes the usual way of getting
     * it: draw last, at the far plane, with `LessEqual` and depth writes off. This draws the sky
     * first instead, because the engine layer's fullscreen mechanism is `SpriteBatch`-based and
     * carries no depth configuration. The guarantee is the same and is asserted; what is given up
     * is the optimisation of skipping sky pixels the scene will cover.

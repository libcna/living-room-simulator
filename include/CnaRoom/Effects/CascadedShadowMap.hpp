     * @brief A directional shadow map split into several depth ranges, so that a large scene keeps
     *        usable shadow resolution near the camera.
     *
     * plans/plan_modern.md Phase 9. One map stretched over a whole outdoor view spends most of its texels
     * on ground the player will never look at closely; splitting the view frustum by distance and
     * fitting a map to each slice spends them where they are seen. The cost is that the casting
     * geometry is drawn once per cascade, which is the contract the app has to accept.
     *
     * Usage is per cascade, and app-driven for the same reason `ShadowMap` is:
     *
     * ```
     * cascades.update(sun, cameraView, cameraProjection);
     * for (int i = 0; i < cascades.getCascadeCount(); ++i)
     * {
     *     cascades.begin(i);
     *     //   ... draw the casters that matter at this range ...
     *     cascades.end();
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * **Storage is an atlas, not a texture array** (`MOD-907`). CNA's renderer interface has no
     * array-texture concept, so every renderer would need one before a single cascade could be
     * stored that way. One wide `RenderTarget2D` with a viewport per cascade needs nothing that is
     * not already there, and the receiver samples it with a UV scale-and-offset it is given.
     *
     * **Fitting is sphere-based** (`MOD-903`). Fitting a box to the cascade's frustum corners
     * produces extents that change as the camera turns, and a shadow map whose extents change
     * every frame shimmers along every edge. The bounding *sphere* of those corners has a radius
     * that does not depend on the camera's orientation at all, so the fitted volume is stable and
     * the only thing that moves is its centre -- which `MOD-904` then snaps to whole texels.

     * @brief Transparency that does not need sorting, and cannot be got wrong by ordering.
     *
     * plans/plan_modern.md `MOD-2106`. `TransparentDrawList` orders draws back to front, which is correct
     * for surfaces that do not interpenetrate and has no answer at all for surfaces that do — two
     * intersecting panes have no correct order, and no per-object sort can invent one. This is the
     * other answer: McGuire and Bavoil's weighted blended order-independent transparency, where
     * every surface contributes to two accumulation buffers with a depth-derived weight and the
     * composite is resolved once. **Submitting in any order produces the same frame**, which is the
     * property sorting cannot promise and this is tested for directly — to within the accumulation
     * buffer's last bit, because it is half-float and the framebuffer rounds after *each* blend.
     * Measured: the two orders differ by at most 1/255 per channel where plain alpha blending on
     * the same pair differs by 57.
     *
     * ```cpp
     * oit.begin(farPlane);
     * DrawTransparentGeometry(effect);   // its shader writes accumulation + revealage outputs
     * oit.end();
     * // ... the opaque frame is bound ...
     * oit.resolve(width, height);
     * ```
     *
     * **One pass, and getting there needed a reformulation.** The published technique accumulates
     * revealage multiplicatively while the colour accumulates additively, which needs a different
     * blend function per draw buffer — `glBlendFunci`, GL ES **3.2** or desktop GL 4.0, above this
     * layer's floor and absent from CNA's `BlendState` besides. Revealage is instead accumulated as
     * the **sum of `log(1 - alpha)`**, which is additive, so both targets share one blend state and
     * the geometry is drawn once; the resolve exponentiates it back. The alternative was a second
     * pass over every transparent surface.
     *
     * **It is an approximation, and the failure mode is stated rather than tuned away**
     * (`MOD-2108`). The weight is a function of depth alone, so a stack of many surfaces spread
     * across a large depth range reads flatter than sorting would — the near ones do not dominate
     * as strongly as they should. It is at its best where sorting is at its worst: many small
     * overlapping surfaces at similar depths.

     * @brief Darkens creases and contact points using scene depth and normals.
     *
     * Ambient light in the direct-lighting model arrives equally from everywhere, which is exactly
     * wrong in a corner: a surface with geometry crowding around it receives less of it. SSAO
     * estimates that occlusion from what is already on screen -- for each pixel, it samples points
     * in the hemisphere around the surface and asks how many of them are behind the depth buffer.
     *
     * It is the one post-process in this layer that needs more than the colour image. Depth and
     * view-space normals must be supplied through @ref PostProcessContext, along with the camera
     * projection used to render them. Without those the pass cannot run and copies its input
     * instead, so a pipeline that enables SSAO without a prepass renders an unoccluded frame
     * rather than failing.
     *
     * The occlusion is applied as a multiply over the whole image. That deliberately darkens
     * direct light along with ambient, which is not physically right; doing it correctly means
     * feeding the AO term into each lit effect's ambient contribution, which is a change to every
     * lit shader rather than a post-process. The screen-space multiply is the standard
     * approximation and is documented as such rather than presented as correct.

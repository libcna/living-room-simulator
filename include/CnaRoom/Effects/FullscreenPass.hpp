     * already implement and verify -- including the part that is easiest to get wrong by hand, the
     * texture-coordinate origin, which differs between GL and D3D and is resolved once inside
     * SpriteBatch rather than separately in every pass shader.

     * The alternative considered was an oversized triangle through `DrawUserPrimitives`, which
     * saves one state block per pass. It was not chosen: it would require every pass shader to
     * match a hand-rolled vertex declaration and to re-derive the UV convention per renderer, for
     * a saving that is invisible next to the fullscreen fill itself.

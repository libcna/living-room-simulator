     * wide enough to look right, costs an order of magnitude more taps for the same spread.

     * separates genuinely bright pixels from merely white ones, which is the effect people mean by
     * bloom; on an 8-bit target a threshold below 1.0 still produces a usable glow, and the pass

         * the preset applied calls `RenderPipelineSettings::applyRenderQualityPresetEXT()`, and an
         * app that has tuned bloom by hand keeps its own number.

         * |---|---|---|---|
         * | `Low`    | 2 | narrow | 11.9 ms |
         * | `Medium` | 3 | the default; wide enough to read as a lens | 12.7 ms |
         * | `High`   | 5 | wide | 14.8 ms |
         * | `Ultra`  | 7 | as wide as the chain reaches before the 2-pixel floor | 15.5 ms |
         *
         * **Read that cost column before reaching for this as a performance dial.** Measured
         * (`MOD-416`), Low to Ultra is a 30% difference, not a threefold one: the first level is
         * half-resolution and dominates, and every level after it is a quarter of the one before, so
         * the pyramid's tail is nearly free. The preset therefore buys *width* rather than saving
         * time, and a frame that cannot afford bloom cannot afford it at `Low` either — the answer
         * there is `setBloomEnabled(false)`, which costs nothing at all (`MOD-209`).
         *
         * On a small frame the higher presets converge, because the chain stops when a level would
         * fall below two pixels: at 128×128, `High` and `Ultra` produce the identical image.
         *
         * **Tap count does not vary with quality**, and that is deliberate rather than unfinished:
         * the blur is a 9-tap separable Gaussian, and dropping taps changes the *shape* of the blur
         * — it starts to look like a box — while saving little, for the same reason the level count
         * saves little. See `docs/cnaext-perf.md` for the measurements.

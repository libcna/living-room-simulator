     * density **integrated along the view ray**. A valley fills while the hilltop above it stays
     * clear, and looking down from the hill through the valley fogs correctly, because the integral
     * knows the ray passed through the thick part.

     * The integral has a closed form, so there is no marching and no step count to tune. It is
     * exposed as @ref opticalDepth so the shader's arithmetic can be checked against a reference
     * rather than against a screenshot.
     *
     * It runs before tonemapping, on scene-referred values: fog replaces distant light with its own,
     * and mixing display-referred values would fade a bright sky and a white wall by the same
     * amount.

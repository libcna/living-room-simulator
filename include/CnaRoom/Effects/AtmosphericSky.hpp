     * `Skybox` draws whatever image it was given. This draws what the air would look like: the blue
     * of a clear day is Rayleigh scattering, which sends short wavelengths sideways far more than
     * long ones, and the white glare around the sun is Mie scattering off larger particles, which
     * barely cares about wavelength at all. Moving the sun down turns the sky orange because the
     * light has further to travel and the blue has been scattered out of it before it arrives.
     *
     * That is what a parameterised sky buys over an image: **a time of day is a number, not an
     * asset.** What it costs is control -- a cube map can hold a photograph or a painting, and this
     * can only hold a sky.
     *
     * It is an alternative to `Skybox` rather than a replacement: the cube path is untouched, and a
     * game that wants an artist's sky keeps using it.

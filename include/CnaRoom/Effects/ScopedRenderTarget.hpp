     * @brief Binds a render target for a scope and puts back whatever was bound before.
     *
     * plans/plan_modern.md `MOD-203`. A post-process pass binds its destination, draws, and moves on —
     * and if the draw throws, the destination stays bound. The next thing to render then draws into
     * a pass's private intermediate instead of the frame, which does not look like an error; it
     * looks like the frame stopped updating. Restoring in a destructor makes the unwind path do the
     * right thing without every pass remembering to.
     *
     * The previous binding is read back from the device rather than assumed to be the back buffer,
     * because a pass can perfectly well run inside another pass's scope — the bloom pyramid does
     * exactly that — and "restore" has to mean the *caller's* target, not the frame's.
     *
     * Restoration in the destructor never throws: a renderer that refuses the restore has already
     * failed at something, and turning that into a second exception during unwind would replace a
     * diagnosable error with `std::terminate`.

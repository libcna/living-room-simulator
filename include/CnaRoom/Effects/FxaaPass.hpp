     * edge's direction. It costs one fullscreen pass and no extra memory, which is what makes it
     * the practical choice where MSAA is unavailable -- notably on a float render target, where
     * multisampling is far less widely supported than on the back buffer.
     *
     * It runs after tonemapping, on displayed pixels. Edge detection on scene-referred values
     * would treat a highlight ten times brighter than white as an enormous edge and blur it into
     * its surroundings.

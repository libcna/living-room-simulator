     * @brief Renders the scene's linear view depth and view-space normals for screen-space effects.
     *
     * plans/plan_modern.md `MOD-501`. SSAO — and any later effect that needs to know the shape of the
     * scene rather than its colour — reads two images: how far each pixel is, and which way it
     * faces. This produces them, and the app drives it the way it drives `ShadowMap`: bracket a
     * draw of the scene, using the effect this hands back.
     *
     * ```cpp
     * for (int pass = 0; pass < prepass.getPassCount(); ++pass)
     * {
     *     prepass.begin(pass, view, projection, nearPlane, farPlane);
     *     DrawSceneGeometry(prepass.getPrepassEffect());   // or getSkinnedPrepassEffect()
     *     prepass.end();
     * }
     * pipeline.setDepthNormalInputs(prepass.getDepthTexture(), prepass.getNormalTexture());
     * ```
     *
     * **Why a prepass and not the depth attachment** (`MOD-500`). Sampling the depth buffer the
     * scene already wrote would be free, and CNA cannot do it portably: several renderers never
     * expose their depth attachment as a texture, the ones that do disagree about its precision and
     * about whether it is readable while still bound, and the value in it is non-linear in a way
     * that differs per API. Rendering depth explicitly costs a second pass over the geometry and is
     * the same everywhere, which is the trade this layer makes throughout.
     *
     * **The loop is not decoration.** With `MultipleRenderTargets` the prepass writes every enabled
     * image in one pass and `getPassCount()` is 1. Without it, depth and normals are written in two
     * passes, or three when velocity is enabled. Writing the loop makes the app correct in either
     * mode; on renderers with MRT it still costs one iteration.

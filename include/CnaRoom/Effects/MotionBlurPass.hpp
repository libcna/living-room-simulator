     * image and the camera, and putting that position through the *previous* frame's camera says
     * where it used to be on screen. The difference is its velocity, and the pass blurs along it.
     *
     * Camera motion works from depth alone. Per-object motion is an opt-in upgrade: when
     * @ref PostProcessContext::sourceVelocity is supplied, written texels replace camera
     * reconstruction with the prepass's combined object-and-camera velocity. Producing that image
     * requires a third prepass output and a previous world matrix per draw, the application
     * contract described by `plans/plan_modern.md` `MOD-2033`.
     *
     * The first frame after a start or a resize has no history, and the pass leaves it alone rather
     * than blurring it along an arbitrary direction.

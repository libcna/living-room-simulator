     * @brief Draws the shafts of light that appear where something bright is partly hidden.
     *
     * Every pixel walks towards the light's position on screen, gathering what it finds and letting
     * it decay with distance. Where the path is clear the gathered light piles up into a shaft;
     * where an occluder stands in the way there is nothing to gather and the shaft is absent. That
     * absence is the effect -- shafts are the *shape of the occluder*, which is why this needs no
     * volume and no marching through one.
     *
     * **The light's position is the app's to supply**, as a screen coordinate: the layer does not
     * know which of a scene's lights is the sun, and projecting one is a line of arithmetic the app
     * already has the matrices for. It may be outside the frame, and the pass fades the effect out
     * as it goes -- a light just past the edge still throws shafts inward, and a hard cut-off at
     * the border is the giveaway this avoids.
     *
     * It runs before tonemapping, on scene-referred values, for the reason bloom and flare do: the
     * threshold that decides what is bright enough to be a light has to separate a light from a
     * white wall, and after tonemapping those are the same number.

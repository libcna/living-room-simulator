     * @brief Screen-space contact shadows: the short-range shadow a shadow map cannot resolve.
     *
     * A shadow map answers "is this point visible from the light" at the resolution of its texture.
     * Where an object meets the surface it rests on, the answer changes over a distance far smaller
     * than one shadow texel, so the map cannot represent it at any resolution a real frame can
     * afford -- the object floats, and no amount of extra shadow-map pixels fixes it, because the
     * error is at the shadow map's own filter width rather than in its content.
     *
     * This pass fills exactly that gap. For each pixel it walks a short ray from the surface toward
     * the light through the prepass depth image and asks whether anything on screen crosses it. A
     * hit within the ray's length darkens the pixel. The range is deliberately short: the ray is
     * paying for the last few centimetres a shadow map rounds away, not for the shadow itself.
     *
     * **It is a complement, not a replacement.** It sees only what the camera sees, so an occluder
     * off screen or hidden behind the surface casts nothing, and the shadow it produces ends where
     * the march does. A scene rendered with contact shadows and no shadow map has short dark
     * contacts and nothing else. The two combine by multiplying their visibility -- see
     * @ref combineVisibility for why that and not adding their occlusions.
     *
     * Requires @ref PostProcessContext::sourceDepth, a projection and its inverse, a far plane and
     * @ref PostProcessContext::inverseView. Without any of them the pass copies its input through
     * and names what was missing in @ref getFallbackReason, so a misconfigured pipeline renders an
     * unshadowed frame rather than failing.

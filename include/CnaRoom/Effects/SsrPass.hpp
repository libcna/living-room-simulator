     * @brief Reflects the scene in itself by marching rays through the depth buffer.
     *
     * The reflection of a surface is found by walking the reflected ray forward in view space,
     * projecting each step back to a screen position, and asking the depth image whether anything
     * is standing there. Where something is, its colour is the reflection; where nothing is, the
     * pixel keeps the colour it had.
     *
     * It reads the same two images `SsaoPass` does -- @ref PostProcessContext::sourceDepth and
     * @ref PostProcessContext::sourceNormals, produced by `DepthNormalPrepass` -- and needs no
     * other input. Without them the pass reports `isSupported() == false` and copies its source
     * through, exactly as SSAO does when the prepass was never run.
     *
     * **What screen-space reflection cannot do.** Only what is already on screen can be reflected.
     * A surface facing away from the camera, an object outside the viewport, and anything hidden
     * behind nearer geometry have no colour in the source image, so they have no reflection. This
     * is the defining limit of the technique rather than a shortcoming of this implementation, and
     * a scene that depends on reflecting off-screen content needs an environment map instead --
     * `ImageBasedLightEXT`, which this pass does not replace.
